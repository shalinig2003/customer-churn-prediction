# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

**Goal:** Predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on their usage and profile.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📈 Key Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Label Encoding & Scaling
3. Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
4. Achieved 85% accuracy with Random Forest
5. Visualized key churn insights and model performance
